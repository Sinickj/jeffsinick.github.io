      <p><strong>Decoding Complexity, Catalyzing Change</strong></p>
      <p>Packing my car and driving 2,500 miles from Texas to Oregon for a job interview, with no viable way to return if things didn’t work out, wasn’t an act of recklessness. It was a declaration of intent. In that moment, as the economic crash of 2008 had reshuffled industries around me, I made a choice that would define my career: I would seek opportunity in uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Four years later, I found myself repeating this pattern—selling everything I owned and crossing the Atlantic to London. Not because I had a guaranteed path forward, but because I recognized that the most valuable transformations happen at the edges of what we know.</p>
      <p>What drives me isn't the comfort of established systems, but the hidden patterns beneath them—the unspoken motivations, the untapped potential buried in complexity, and the catalytic insights that can reshape entire industries. I'm fascinated by the spaces between what is and what could be.</p>

      <p><strong>From Streaming Revolution to System Transformation</strong></p>
      <p>My journey began at Netflix during a pivotal moment—the birth of the streaming revolution. While managing technology operations, I witnessed firsthand how strategic decisions and cultural innovation could transform not just a company, but an entire industry.</p>
      <p>This experience sparked a curiosity that would later drive me across continents to pursue an MBA at Imperial College London, immersing myself in the vibrant intersection of technology startups and design thinking.</p>

      <p><strong>Reshaping Legacy Industries</strong></p>
      <p>At DXC Technology, I led strategy for one of the most ambitious shifts in insurance: the modernization of London Markets Central Services—the backbone of the UK's commercial specialty insurance sector.</p>
      <p>This wasn't just about digital upgrades. It was about reshaping the future of a centuries-old industry, redesigning how risk was placed and processed at a global scale.</p>

      <p><strong>Catalyzing New Ventures</strong></p>
      <p>At Syngenta, I led the global digital strategy for Cropwise. Agriculture stands at the intersection of our era's most pressing challenges—climate volatility, food security, and sustainability.</p>
      <p>I'm equally passionate about catalyzing new ventures—from service design in early-stage startups to rearchitecting entire ecosystems for multinational companies.</p>

      <p><strong>The Power of Not Knowing</strong></p>
      <p>For me, ambiguity isn't a challenge—it's where value creation begins. I've built my career on decoding complexity, uncovering the hidden forces that drive change, and developing strategies that move industries forward.</p>
      <p>Let's connect if you're exploring transformation, building something new, or navigating complexity.</p>
